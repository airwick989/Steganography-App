- Last completed login and get secrets with steg server. Next work on sending message, so just modify the uploader component
a bit and get it to log events in the db, I don't think we need table for user_images cause we can just check the names of the
images in the python files (make sure to make that modification in the uploader component as well)

- Make steg server with functionalities to take input text, secrets file, and image and ...
uploads an encoded image (name is exact timestamp.png or .jeg) to the Comm-Server (store it in a folder called uploads?)
