- Last completed uploading functionality, now keep working on the Comm-Server's upload function to then make a request
to the Steg-Server to encode the image and whatnot. This means setting up the Steg-Server as a flask server.

uploads an encoded image (name is exact timestamp.png or .jeg) to the Comm-Server (store it in a folder called uploads?)
